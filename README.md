A Rock Paper Scissors Simulator made in c++

There are 2 versions

1.0:
 This version is somewhat choppy in the text output an does not off as much features as 2.0;
 
2.0:
 This version is a completely updated version of the original. The animations are much smoother and the source code is more organized and compact.
 
 
 
 I made this becuase I was bored.
